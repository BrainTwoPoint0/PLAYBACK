<!-- NEXT STEP PLAN -->

## 📌 Next Step Implementation Plan – Registration & Onboarding (Sprint 1)

Following the successful completion of the login flow and its brand-aligned UI overhaul, the next immediate priority is to enable **new user sign-up** and a **guided onboarding experience** that captures core profile data.

### Objectives

1. Implement secure email/password **registration flow** using Supabase Auth.
2. Add **initial profile setup wizard** (sport selection, basic info) shown on first login.
3. Provide **password reset** support via email link.
4. Ensure flows follow PLAYBACK UI/UX guidelines (mobile-first, dark theme, tokens).

### Todo

- [ ] Create `/auth/register` route with branded form (email, password, confirm password).
- [ ] Validate inputs client-side using shared validators (`validateEmail`, `validatePassword`).
- [ ] Call `supabase.auth.signUp` and handle errors (surface via `getAuthErrorMessage`).
- [ ] Redirect to **Verify Email** screen with resend link & deep-link instructions.
- [ ] Build password reset request page (`/auth/forgot-password`) and reset form (`/auth/reset/[token]`).
- [ ] Add **middleware** to detect first-time login (`profile.completed = false`) and redirect to `/onboarding` wizard.
- [ ] Scaffold onboarding wizard (multi-step):
  1. Choose primary sport.
  2. Pick playing position.
  3. Enter display name & avatar.
  4. Confirmation.
- [ ] Persist onboarding data to `profiles` table (`update`).
- [ ] Update RLS policies if needed for new inserts/updates.
- [ ] Storybook stories for registration form & onboarding steps.
- [ ] Update **docs/ui-ux-guidelines.md** with component variants if new ones created.

### Definition of Done

- New users can register, verify email, and complete onboarding without console errors.
- All pages pass Lighthouse accessibility >90 and respect dark theme tokens.
- Unit tests cover validation & redirect logic (>90% lines for new utils/components).
- CI pipeline green.
